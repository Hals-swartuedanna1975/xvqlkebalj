OMG, okay, so I just watched Inception, and I'm like, dude, what even just happened?? I mean, what was that final scene? Is Cobb dreaming? Is he awake? I'm sitting here like, come on, give me SOME closure, PLEASE! It's been like the third time, and it still messes with my head. And seriously, that rotating hallway fight scene is just staying rent-free in my brain forever. Nolan really knows how to twist reality, right?

Yo, and that whole dream within a dream thing? I tried explaining it to my dad, and he just gave me this look... you know the one, like are you okay? Dude, even I'm not sure anymore. I feel like I need a PhD in dreams just to keep up with this plot. And can we talk about Hans Zimmer's score? I still hear those epic BRAAAAMS when I'm trying to sleep. Help. ðŸ˜‚

> I swear, next time, I'm just gonna download the movie and skip to the end just to see the top scene again. But then, like, why even try to understand? Maybe the whole point is to be confused? Gotta admit, all the layers have me questioning my own reality now ðŸ˜‚

Like, why did I bother writing down theories? I have sticky notes around my desk like some kind of conspiracy theorist. Architect this, subconscious that. And don't even get me started on the cast. Leo, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page... I can't complain, but my brain sure can!

Anyway, remember when we tried to watch the movie last summer? Honestly, every time itâ€™s like a new experience. I thought it'd get easier, but nooope, still have no idea ðŸ˜‚ Man, I'm so sleep-deprived, but it's worth it. Heading to bed with a degree in dream analysis, haha!

Man, Iâ€™ve been rambling. All this dreaming nonsense got me craving ice cream. Dream-flavored, maybe? Haha. Letâ€™s catch up soon. Peace!
